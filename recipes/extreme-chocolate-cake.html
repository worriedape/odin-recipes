    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p></p>

        <li>While cakes cool, make frosting: Cream butter with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Stir in confectioners' sugar and cocoa alternately with milk and vanilla. Beat to a smooth spreading consistency.</li>
        <li>Split the layers of the cooled cake horizontally, cover the top of each layer with frosting, then stack them onto a serving plate.</li>
        <li>Frost the outside of the cake with remaining frosting.</li>
